# Txt-fit

Solution how to fit the entire text into the predefined box, no matter the font size. 

The common problem on such a task is the unpredictability related to how browsers render fonts and of course the fonts themselves.

Note:
It uses the _get_W()and _get_H() to retrieve  width or the height of an element.
The _get_W() and _get_H() returns the width or the height of an element or 0 if the size can not be found/calculated
